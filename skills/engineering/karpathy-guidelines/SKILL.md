# Karpathy Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common coding-agent mistakes, derived from [Andrej Karpathy's observations](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876) on LLM coding pitfalls.

This is a lightweight behavior guardrail. If a task is clearly a bug fix, test-first change, or release workflow, use the more specific debugging, TDD, or verification workflow in addition to these guidelines.

## Fast Path

For obvious one-line or mechanical changes, apply only the essentials:
- Keep the diff minimal.
- Match existing style.
- Verify the specific change if cheap.

For non-trivial work, use the full guidelines below.

## When Not to Use

Skip this skill when the task is purely informational, requires no code or review decision, or is already governed by a more specific mandatory workflow.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Don't reformat whole files unless the user asked or the project tool requires it.
- Don't migrate style, naming, types, or architecture unless required by the task.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

Before claiming completion, name the verification actually performed: test command, lint command, manual check, or why verification was not possible.

For calibration examples, read `EXAMPLES.md` when applying or revising this skill.
